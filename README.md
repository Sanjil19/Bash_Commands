## About

This repo started as a way to practice Bash commands for project setup (creating folders/files), moving files, and other common shell tasks. Along the way, I learned to better use Git branches, commit changes, and manage multiple workflows locally and remotely.

## Bash Commands

Hereâ€™s a handy Bash snippet to quickly create multiple project folders, each with starter files:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  mkdir "project$i" && touch "project$i/index.html" "project$i/style.css" "project$i/script.js"
done
